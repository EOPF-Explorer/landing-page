## High-level Overview

The EOPF-Explorer is the product of the integration of the following:

-   **Static Site Generation**: The landing page is a static site generated by [Vitepress](https://vitepress.dev/). This allows for content to be written in Markdown, with the ability to use Vue components within the pages for enhanced interactivity.
-   **Dashboarding**: The Sentinel Browser is powered by [eodash](https://eodash.org/), a flexible tool for creating web-based dashboards for Earth Observation data.
-   **UI Components**: The user interface is enhanced with [EOxElements](https://eox-a.github.io/EOxElements/), a library of web components for Earth Observation applications.

## Replicating the Dashboard

You can create your own instance of a similar dashboard by following these steps:

- Start by creating a new repository from the [eodash pages template](https://github.com/eodash/eodash-pages-template). The template sets up a Vitepress site where you can create pages using Markdown. You can also embed custom Vue components to add more complex features.
- The template includes a page with an `eodash` instance already set up. You can customize this instance to build your own browser for Zarr-powered data or other sources.
- To further customize your dashboard, you can refer to [eodash client documentation](https://eodash.github.io/eodash) and https://eodash.org to learn more.
